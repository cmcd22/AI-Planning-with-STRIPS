## Assignment code for applying ML to planning problems

- All code files were supplied and built upon; I did not write all code
- The attached report details exactly what was added/expanded upon

### Assignment task was as follows:

- Select one of the STRIPS planners provided in AIPython and install it on your computer. The STRIPS planners
depend on other Python code in AIPython, which you need to install as well. Once you have a runnable STRIPS
planner, you can continue with creating planning problems.  
You are supposed to find two significantly diï¬€erent planning problems and represent them so that your STRIPS
planner can solve them.

- I used the Monkey-Banana problem and the River Crossing problem
